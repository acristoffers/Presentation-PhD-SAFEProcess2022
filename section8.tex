  \begin{itemize}
    \item The formulation is straightforward, optimization based and extendable.
    \item The graininess \(\mu\) can change randomly to avoid attack vectors
          which may also affect the time-scale system. Better yet, techniques as
          the Game Theorie's Moving Target can give the best strategies to
          changing its value.
